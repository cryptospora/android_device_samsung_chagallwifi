SM-T800 device repo for CyangenMod 12 Lollipop.

Full credit and Thanks to Christopher Palmer @  https://github.com/crpalmer for doing the legwork on getting picassowifi working for cm12 which paves the way for chagallwifi to also work.

This is a work in progress.

Make sure you do a full factory reset/wipe data etc before flashing from another rom and give the first boot a good 5 minutes to start for the firt time.
